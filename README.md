# Git Remote Url:
This _very_ simple plugin simply maps <leader>yg and <leader> yG to fetch the remote url for main and your current branch respectively.

## Installation
Lazy:
```lua
return {
  'JojoMakesGames/git-remote-url.nvim',
  opts = {}
}
```

### Notes:
This is a very simple plugin that will be recieving updates to follow plugin standards such as not automagically setting keybindings, just wanted to see real quick how easy it was to create a plugin!
